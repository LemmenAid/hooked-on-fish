## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

<br>
The following validation errors appear on the signup page when using Django allauth: 
<br>
<br>

1. "End tag p implied, but there were open elements" 
- This occurs because the default form rendering does not close < p > or < span > tags properly when rendering help text.

2. "Unclosed element span" and "Stray end tag span" 
- These errors are due to the way Django allauth handles help text within form fields. It wraps help text in < span > tags but does not ensure strict compliance with HTML validation rules.

3. "No p element in scope but a p end tag seen" 
- Django allauth uses < p > tags inconsistently, which causes this error when rendering form errors or help texts.
<br>

These errors are caused by the default Django form rendering engine used by allauth, which generates the HTML automatically. While these issues do not affect functionality, fixing them would require overriding the templates or form rendering logic entirely.

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

| File | Jigsaw URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| style.css | [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fcoastal-gardens-e950c82335fb.herokuapp.com%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en) | ![screenshot](TESTING-files/css-style.png) | Pass: No Errors |

***

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files (the comments.js file, the contact-zone-map.js file and the javascript in the base.html file). After inserting /*jshint esversion: 6 */ at the top of the file no errors were returned apart from one undefined variable - bootstrap.

| File | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| comments.js | ![screenshot](TESTING-files/js-comments.png) | One undefined variable "bootstrap" see below. |
| contact-zone-map.js | ![screenshot](TESTING-files/js-contact-zone-map.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| JavaScript in the base.html | ![screenshot](TESTING-files/js-base.png) | One undefined variable "bootstrap" see below. |


One undefined variable "bootstrap".

This appears when using Bootstrap's JavaScript components (like new bootstrap.Modal in the comments.js file.) because JSHint doesn't recognize the bootstrap object as a global variable, even though it is defined globally by the included Bootstrap JS file.
This is a common issue with external libraries that define global variables. JSHint doesn't automatically detect these variables unless they are declared in the configuration.

***

### Python

### Testing Error Pages

To ensure that custom error pages (e.g., 400, 403, 404, and 500 errors) display correctly, the following setup was implemented during development for testing purposes.

1. A temporary route was added in urls.py to trigger various error responses manually.
2. The temporary test_error view raises specific exceptions or returns error status codes to simulate different error scenarios.<br>

![Screenshot](TESTING-files/testing%20error%20pages..png)

<br>

Testing Procedure<br>
1. Visit the /test-error/ URL in your browser. 
2. Uncomment one of the lines in the test_error function at a time to simulate the desired error.
3. Reload the page and verify the correct error template is displayed.
4. Check that the page matches your custom design for error pages.

For the 404 test, a non-existent URL was accessed directly instead of using the /test-error route.



***

### Browser Compatibility

Coastal Gardens was tested through the Heroku app website on the following browsers without issues:  
- Google Chrome (Version 132.0.6834.6) | Works as expected
- Mozilla Firefox (Version 132.0) | Works as expected
- Safari (Version 20619.2.8) | Works as expected
- Microsoft Edge (Version 131.0.2903.51) | Works as expected

***

### Responsiveness
* The website has been tested on different devices(under which; iPhone SE / iPhone 12 / Samsung Galaxy S9 / MacBook Air / MacBook Pro / HP laptop).
* The website was responsive on all screens from mobile phones to desktops.
* Chrome DEV Tools have been used to check the responsivness throughout the development of the website.

### Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.
Overall I am happy with the outcome. However, the Best Practices is significantly influenced by Cloudinary images.

### Automated Testing

#### Python (Unit Testing)

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python3 manage.py test name-of-app `

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

`coverage run --source=name-of-app manage.py test`

`coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

`coverage html`

`python3 -m http.server`

Below are the results from the various apps on my application that I've tested:

| App | File | Coverage | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Blog | tests.py | 93% | ![screenshot](TESTING-files/automated-blog.png) |
| About | tests.py | 100% | ![screenshot](TESTING-files/automated-about.png) |
| Dashboard | tests.py | 99% | ![screenshot](TESTING-files/automated-dashboard.png) |

### Solved Bugs

* During testing I replaced the Post.objects.get() line with get_object_or_404 in my save_post view. This ensures that if the Post with the given post_id does not exist, Django will return a 404 response instead of raising an exception.

* Added the 'status=1' filter in the user_dashboard view, to only include stories that are published in "Your Stories".

* During testing of my error pages, I realized that the order of URL paths in urls.py is crucial. Specifically, the empty ("") path must always be the last entry. Initially, my error page tests werenâ€™t working because I had added the test paths at the end, which caused the empty path to interfere. Once I corrected the order, everything worked as expected.

* The else block of my create_stories_view was being executed every time the request method was GET, which ment that the error message from the view was added even when the user first visits the page (without having submitted the form/published the story). To fix this, I moved the error message handling to the part of the code where the form is checked for validity.
